		<h3>About Us</h3>
		<p class="important">The Federal Bar Association (FBA), founded in 1920, is dedicated to the advancement of the science of jurisprudence and to promoting the welfare, interests, education, and professional development of all attorneys involved in federal law. Our members run the gamut of federal practice: attorneys practicing in small to large legal firms, attorneys in corporations and federal agencies, and members of the judiciary. The FBA is the catalyst for communication between the bar and the bench, as well as the private and public sectors.</p>

		<h4 id="fourth">What We Do</h4>

		<p><strong>Advocacy</strong><br>
		The opportunity to make a change and improve the federal legal system through grassroots work in almost 100 FBA chapters and a strong national advocacy.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Networking</strong><Br>
		Connect with a vast network of federal practitioners extending across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  
		</p>

		<p><strong>Leadership</strong><Br>
		Governance positions within the association help shape the FBA’s future and make an impact on the growth of the federal legal community.
